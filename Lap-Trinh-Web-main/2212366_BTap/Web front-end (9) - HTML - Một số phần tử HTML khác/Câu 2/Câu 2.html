    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    
    <p>This week I am <em>  extremely </em>excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide.</dfn> 
         In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is <em>precisely</em> set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
            In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
    
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30"></time> November 30.</p>
